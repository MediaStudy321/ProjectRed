            engaging game-play. The player is thrusted headfirst into the depths of the underworld and embarks on a quest to
            acquire only the most pristine fighters for their roster! Battle your way through hell’s colosseum to become the 
            most fearsome warrior! To begin, the player is given a starter character after completing the tutorial and 
            must complete win the first two battles to acquire the next couple starters in the first level. After these 
            battles, the player has their first complete roster. Each successful battle will grant the player a currency in 
            which they can use to trade characters, sell characters, and buy loot boxes which allow them to roll for a chance 
            to win new and exciting characters! Battles will become increasingly difficult. The max roster size is three, and 
            the player has opportunities to trade and sell these characters with other players. Players may chat, trade, and 
            interact with other players outside of hell’s colosseum to learn the ropes or discuss different strategies!
