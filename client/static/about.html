        <div id="center"><h3>Welcome to (Game)! (Game) is a multiplayer, fantasy RPG with wacky demons, intense battles, and 
            engaging game-play. The player is thrusted headfirst into the depths of the underworld and embarks on a quest to
            acquire only the most pristine fighters for their roster! Battle your way through hell’s colosseum to become the 
            most fearsome warrior! To begin, the player is given a starter character after completing the tutorial and 
            must complete win the first two battles to acquire the next couple starters in the first level. After these 
            battles, the player has their first complete roster. Each successful battle will grant the player a currency in 
            which they can use to trade characters, sell characters, and buy loot boxes which allow them to roll for a chance 
            to win new and exciting characters! Battles will become increasingly difficult. The max roster size is three, and 
            the player has opportunities to trade and sell these characters with other players. Players may chat, trade, and 
            interact with other players outside of hell’s colosseum to learn the ropes or discuss different strategies! 
            Participate in the community with your own discussions and battle methods! Good luck! </h3></div>

            <div id="center"><h1>Combat</h1></div>

            <div id="center"><h3>Battles are turn-based and initiated by the player. In combat, the player may choose among several moves. 
                Each move has it's own purpose, whether it be inflicting damage upon the opponent or regenerating health. Each character has it's own health bar which will influence the outcome of each battle. Some moves will deal more damage 
                than others, so it's important to maintain health throughout the battle. If one of your characters is defeated, you still 
                have additional oppurtunities with what remains in your roster. If all of your fighters are defeated, the battle is lost. </h3></div>

            <div id="center"><h3>When battles are won, they grant the player a currency in which they can use to trade characters, sell 
                characters, and buy loot boxes which enable them to roll for a chance to win new and exciting characters! Each 
                loot box could contain a number of different items, from characters to healing potions. There are two types of
                loot boxes, one with a greater chance of reciving better characters with less items than the other. These items 
                and characters can be traded between players. </h3></div>
