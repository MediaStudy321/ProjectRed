        <div id="center"><h3>Welcome to (Game)! (Game) is a multiplayer, fantasy RPG with wacky demons, intense battles, and engaging
            game-play. The player is thrusted headfirst into the depths of the underworld and embarks on a quest to
            acquire only the most pristine fighters for their roster! Battle your way through hell’s colosseum to
            become the most fearsome warrior! To begin, the player is granted a starter character after completing
            the tutorial and must complete win the first two battles to acquire the next couple starters in the
            first level. The battles require the player to select an appropriate move to inflict as much damage as
            possible to their opponents. The player must maintain their character’s health to win the battle, and
            has the opportunity to use other characters from their roster if a particular character is defeated.
            After these battles, the player has their first complete roster. Each successful battle will grant the
            player a currency in which they can use to trade characters, sell characters, and buy loot boxes which
            allow them to roll for a chance to win new and exciting characters! Successful battles also allow the
            player to progress by unlocking achievements which yield currency prizes. Battles will become
            increasingly difficult. Once the player finishes all battles in battlefield 1, the player moves on to
            battlefield 2 in which battles become even more difficult. The max roster size is three, and the player
            has opportunities to trade and sell these characters with other players. Players may chat, trade, and
            interact with other players outside of hell’s colosseum to learn the ropes or discuss different
            strategies! Participate in the community with your own discussions and battle methods! Good luck!</h3></div>
