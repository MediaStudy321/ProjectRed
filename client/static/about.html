        <h2 align="center">Combat</h2>

        <p>Battles are turn-based and initiated by the player. In combat, the player may select from several actions. Each action 
            or move has it's own purpose, whether it be inflicting damage upon the opponent or regenerating health. Each 
            character has their own health bar and the player must conserve their health throughout the battle in order to emerge 
            victorious. Some moves will deal more damage than others, so it is important to choose wisely. If one of the player's 
            characters is defeated in battle, they still have additional oppurtunities with what characters remain in their 
            roster. If all of the player's fighters are defeated, the battle is lost. </p>
        
        <h2 align="center">Rolls</h2>

        <p>When battles are won, the player in granted gold in which they can use to trade characters, sell characters, and 
            purchase loot boxes which enable them to roll for a chance to win new and exciting characters! Each loot box could 
            contain a number of different items, from characters to healing potions. There are two types of loot boxes, one with 
            a greater chance of reciving tougher characters with less items than the other. These items and characters can be 
            traded between players. </p>
