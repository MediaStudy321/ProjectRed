        <div id="center"><h3>Battles are turn-based and initiated by the player. In combat, the player may choose among
            several moves. Each move has it's own purpose, whether it be inflicting damage upon the opponent or regenerating health.
            Each character has it's own health bar which will influence the outcome of each battle. Some moves will deal more damage 
            than others, so it's important to maintain health throughout the battle. If one of your characters is defeated, you still 
            have additional oppurtunities with what remains in your roster. If all of your fighters are defeated, the battle is lost. </h3></div>
